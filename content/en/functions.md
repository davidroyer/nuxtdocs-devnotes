- A function that returns another function is a **higher order function**

- JavaScript functions can:

  - Be stored in variables.
  - Be returned from a function.
  - Be passed as arguments into another function.

## Callbacks

- A function that takes other functions as arguments (and/or returns a function, as we learned in the previous section) is known as a higher-order function.
- A function that is passed as an argument into another function is called a **callback** function.
